Planned Improvements
====================

As with any software development project, the product is never truly complete. There is always more to add and new issues to fix. Here is a list of a few planned improvements.

1. Account for waterfall permissions with Change Management Script
	Currently, the changemanagement.ps1 is not working. Use functionalchangemanagement.ps1 instead. Changes will need to be made to the full script to account for Box's waterfall permissions model.

2. Have the .csv from Box Reports go to a SQL database which connects to Power BI
		.csv report > SQL database > Power BI
