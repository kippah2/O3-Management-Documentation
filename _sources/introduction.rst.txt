Introduction
===============

Welcome to the O3 Notes Repo documentation!

This system was designed with extensibility and servicability in mind. This documentation
aims to assist administrators in understanding the underlying technology and logic of this
system so that they may use, repair, add-onto, or change how O3 notes are stored and 
maintained using Box.

**Objective**
-------------

The goal of this project was to create a repository for storing and managing O3 notes.
	* Employees should not be able to go back and modify their previous meeting notes.
	* Ensure Confidentiality, Integrity, and Accessibility of data.
	* Provide an intuitive end-user experience.
	* Generate dashboards so HR can track that O3s are being done.


**Why Box?**
------------

Box was chosen as the platform for this project for the following reasons:
	* Cost savings
		* Majority of Truebeck personnel already have Box licenses.
	* Unlimited Storage
		* Box offers unlimited storage for Business Plus plan subscribers.
		* Considering the volume of O3 notes generated and stored, 
		  this scalability is critical.
	* Box-CLI
		* Being able to perform Box actions from a command line opens the 
		  door to automating repetitive tasks and complete extensibility.
	* User Friendly
		* Most employees are already using Box and know how to navigate its 
		  interface.
	* Access Controls
		* Designed to support multiple users with varying levels of access on 
		  a per-file and per-folder basis.
	* Reporting
		* Box can generate detailed reports on various functions. HR can view 
		  helpful graphics for O3 compliance monitoring.
