ReportPipeline.ps1
==================

The reportpipeline.ps1 script is important as it is responsible for retrieveing the last created report from Box and 
moving it into a shared folder. The report is then pulled from this folder by the data team to be used as input into 
PowerBI for the dashboard.

The script requires an API token. To retrieve this token:
	1. Go to Box.com
	2. In the bottom left of the blue sidebar, click "Dev Console".
	3. Click on the relevant Box CLI App (you can check creation date for the latest).
	4. Click the "Configuration" tab.
	5. Click "Generate Developer Token".
	6. Click "Copy"
	7. Paste API token in powershell script's $BoxAPIToken variable.

You will also want to set the $ParentFolderId variable to the location where Box reports are being stored after being generated.

Because the filepath where the report is downloaded to uses "..\..\", you will need to run this script in the directory where the 
script is stored.

Make sure to set the $destinationFolder variable to the filepath on your machine to the shared Box folder. This script is designed 
to work when Box is available from the host machine's file explorer.
