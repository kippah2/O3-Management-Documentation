Box Report to PowerBI Pipeline
======================================

For the demo, a report was ran on Box and returned a .csv file. .csv was converted to .xlsx. This data was edited to resemble actual employee use. The data was then imported into PowerBI to make the dashboard.

Data that Box Reports
---------------------

Owner Name, Owner, Path, Path ID, Item Name, Item Type, Size, Created, Last Modified, and Uploaded

Columns Added to Manipulate Data
--------------------------------

1. **Name from Path**
	* Description: Extracts Name from column "Path"
	* Formula: =MID(C9, SEARCH("/O3 Notes/", C9) + 10, SEARCH("'s", C9, SEARCH("'s",C9) -2) - SEARCH("/O3 Notes/", C9)-10) 
				*Where C9 is the cell in "Path"*
	* Example: Input: "All Files/O3 Notes/AlGomez's O3 Notes/Archived/2023-06/"
			   Output: AlGomez

2. **int Size**
	* Description: Gets integer value from "Size Column"
	* Formula: =VALUE(LEFT(I9,LEN(I9)-2))
				*Where I9 is the cell in "Size Column"*

3. **Department M**
	* Description: The Department that the employee is in, right now manually entered
	* Formula: n/a
	* Comment: For the future, Box reports should be modified to report this information

Additional Sheet Specifically for PowerBI
-----------------------------------------

1. **Name**
	* Description: Equal to each unique entry in "Name from Path"
	* Formula: n/a

2. **Number Completed** 
	* Description: Number of files that comply with O3 guidelines
	* Formula: =COUNTIFS(J:J,">=7.0",D:D,P4,H:H,"=File")
		       *Where J is "int Size", D is "Name from Path", H is "Item Type"*
	* Comment: Right now compliancy is based off of File Size that is greater than 7KB, Item Type is File, and if the name matches in the File Path
			   In the future, may want to add an additional requirement that a comment on the file has been made. (Meaning employee made an agenda)

3. **Compliant** 
	* Description: If the "Number Completed" >= Amount of O3 Meetings Required
	* Formula: =IF(Q4>=6,"Yes","No")
				*Where Q4 is the cell from "Number Completed" Column* 
	* Comment: For right now, compliancy is at least 3 O3 meetings a month (3 files with 7.0KB or more)
			   Will have to create a formula calculating the number of months passed in the calender year multiplied by 3 to make the minimum amount
			   HR may require more or less which this formula can easily be edited 

4. **Department**
	* Description: Department of the Employee
	* Formula: n/a
	* Comment: As mentioned before, as of right now Department is manually entered but in the future Box will report it 

5. **Manager**
	* Description: Manager of Employee 
	* Formula: n/a
	* Comment: As mentioned before, as of right now Manually is manually entered but in the future Box will report it
